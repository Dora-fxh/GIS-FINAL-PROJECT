The result of GWR model shows that the influence of different explanatory variables varies in different region, which indicates the existence of Spatial non-stationarity. Moreover, GWR is more analytical in regional obesity analysis and can help us effectively and comprehensively dig out more information. Among three independent variables, PHY_ACT might be the dominant variables and ALCOHOL seems to only affect certain regions when modelling obesity rates for adults in GWR.
