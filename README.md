# GIS-FINAL-PROJECT
the folder called "data" containes two datasets. one is the shp folder of Counties and Unitary Authorities boundaries in England and Wales with super generalized (200m) resolution, the other is a CSV file contains 150 Upper Tier Local Authorities in England (City of London and Isles of Scilly is excluded due to small sample numbers) which is extraced from a XLSX file called the "Health-related behaviours and healthy life expectancy" and renamed as "EnglandObesity.csv". Both data sets are collected from Office for National Statics.

The "gisFinalProject.Rmd" file includes all the code used to build the MLR model and GWR model.

This project could be pulled from github and run directly.
